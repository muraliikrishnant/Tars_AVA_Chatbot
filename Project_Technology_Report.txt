PROJECT TECHNOLOGY REPORT
=========================

1. PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
------------------------

1.1. Python (Backend)
   - Role: Primary language for the server-side application.
   - Usage: Handles API requests, business logic, and integration with the AI model.
   - Version: 3.x (Implied by usage of modern libraries).

1.2. JavaScript (Frontend)
   - Role: Primary language for the client-side application.
   - Usage: Powers the interactive user interface, state management, and API communication.
   - Specification: ECMAScript Modules (ESM) as indicated by "type": "module" in package.json.

1.3. HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language)
   - Role: Structure of the web application.
   - Usage: Defines the semantic structure of the chat interface and landing page.

1.4. CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets)
   - Role: Styling and Layout.
   - Usage: Controls the visual appearance, including the chat widget design, animations, and responsiveness.

2. SOFTWARE TOOLS & FRAMEWORKS
------------------------------

2.1. Backend Frameworks & Libraries

   - FastAPI
     - Description: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints.
     - Purpose: Serves as the core web server, defining endpoints like `/chat` and handling HTTP requests/responses.

   - Uvicorn
     - Description: An ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) web server implementation.
     - Purpose: Runs the FastAPI application, handling the low-level network connections.

   - Google Generative AI SDK (`google-generativeai`)
     - Description: The official Python client library for Google's Gemini models.
     - Purpose: Facilitates communication with the Gemini API for generating chatbot responses.

   - BeautifulSoup4 (`beautifulsoup4`)
     - Description: A Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.
     - Purpose: Used for web scraping to extract company information from the Tars Group website to populate the chatbot's knowledge base.

   - Requests (`requests`)
     - Description: A simple, yet elegant HTTP library for Python.
     - Purpose: Used in conjunction with BeautifulSoup to fetch web pages for scraping.

   - Python-Multipart (`python-multipart`)
     - Description: A streaming multipart parser for Python.
     - Purpose: Required by FastAPI to handle form data processing (often a dependency for file uploads or specific request types).

   - Python-Dotenv (`python-dotenv`)
     - Description: Reads key-value pairs from a `.env` file and can set them as environment variables.
     - Purpose: Manages configuration and secrets (like the API Key) securely.

   - Pydantic
     - Description: Data validation and settings management using python type annotations.
     - Purpose: Defines the data models (`ChatMessage`, `ChatRequest`, `ChatResponse`) to ensure API inputs and outputs are valid.

2.2. Frontend Frameworks & Libraries

   - React
     - Description: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
     - Version: ^19.2.0
     - Purpose: Component-based architecture for building the chat widget and application UI.

   - Vite
     - Description: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
     - Version: ^7.2.4
     - Purpose: Handles development server, hot module replacement (HMR), and bundling the application for production.

   - Lucide React
     - Description: A clean and consistent icon library for React.
     - Version: ^0.555.0
     - Purpose: Provides the icons used in the UI (e.g., chat bubbles, close buttons, send icons).

   - ESLint
     - Description: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code.
     - Purpose: Ensures code quality and consistency during development.

3. APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES (APIs)
--------------------------------------------

3.1. Google Gemini API
   - Provider: Google DeepMind / Google AI
   - Model Used: `gemini-2.0-flash`
   - Purpose: The "brain" of the chatbot. It processes user input, maintains context (via history), and generates natural language responses based on the provided system prompt and company information.

3.2. Internal REST API (Self-Hosted)
   - Endpoint: `POST /chat`
   - Description: The custom endpoint created in `main.py`.
   - Purpose: Acts as the bridge between the frontend React app and the backend logic (which calls Gemini). It handles the request formatting and response parsing.
